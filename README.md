 # Introduction
 Every day we get a lot of messages on our phones. Most of the times they are genuine messages from our
 friends, family, and other contacts, but we also do receive unwanted spam messages.The concept of spam
 is rather subjective; however, we can agree that most of the times these are advertisements, scams, money
 making schemes, pornography, and so on.
 In this project, we use the SMS Spam Collection Data Set– made available by the University of California,
 Irvine Machine Learning Repository– that contains 5574 SMS messages that are classified as spam or ham
 (genuine message). A quick look at the documentation tells us that the texts were collected from people in
 the UK and Singapore. Using the texts, we will generate features, which we will use to train and evaluate our classification model.
